## Courses

Resources on every course offered at Queen's University.

These resources are split into different schemas, the main reason being that
`courses` and `departments` are constant factual information, whereas course
`sections` are constantly changing.

Thereâ€™s also the consideration of *relative* course information, such as
ANAT 416 in Fall 2018 vs ANAT 416 in Winter 2017, which will have different
enrollment capacities, waitlists, lecture slots & times, etc.

The three schemas are:

- [Courses](#courses)
- [Departments](#departments)
- [Sections](#sections)

##### JSON File Format
`<year>_<term>_<academic_level>_<campus>_<department>_<course_code>.json`

##### JSON File Format: Sample
`2018_Fall_Undergraduate_Main_CISC_235.json`

#### Developer Notes

##### Section Uniqueness
Multiple courses with the same ID can exist. Such as MATH121 for main
campus, bader campus, or online. In order for a course listing to be
unique, these 6 datapoints must be distinct as a bundle:

- `year`
- `term`
- `academic_level`
- `campus`
- `department`
- `course_code`

E.g: A formatted ID would be `2018_Fall_Undergraduate_Main_CISC_235` if it
were a file, and `2018-Fall-Undergraduate-Main-CISC-235` otherwise.

##### Known key-values
The following keys have been found during scrapes. Some are exhaustive while others are variable:

##### `year`
Any

##### `term`
- `Fall`
- `Summer`
- `Winter`

##### `academic_level`
- `Undergraduate`
- `Graduate`
- `Undergraduate_Online`
- `Non_Credit`

##### `campus`
- `Main`
- `Bader`
- `None`

##### `department`
Any

##### `course_code`
Any

Note: For course header bundles, realize that `academic_level` and `campus` must be unique *as a pair*. For example, **MATH 121** has 3 valid pair possibilities:

1) `academic_level`: Undergraduate,  `campus`: Main
2) `academic_level`: Undergraduate,  `campus`: Bader
3) `academic_level`: Undergraduate_Online,  `campus`: Main
